# presence.md

`presence.md` is a tiny HTTP server that generates a minimalistic blog from Markdown files.

## Features

* In-memory store of articles updated on filesystem events
* CommonMark-compliant
* Syntax highlighting
* Gzip compression
* TLS support
* RSS

## Installation

Make sure [Go](https://golang.org/) is installed on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/climech/presence.md.git
cd presence.md
make test
make && sudo make install
```

Copy the contents of `./config` to `~/.config/presence` to get started.

## Configuration

Refer to the self-documented `config.yml` in the example config.

## Usage

### Create a new post

Create new Markdown document somewhere on your system with an URL-friendly filename, e.g. `words-separated-by-dashes.md`.

```
# Hello world!

This is a blog post.
```

Place the file inside `posts_dir` defined in your `config.yml`. The file will be immediately renamed to include the current Unix timestamp and loaded into. The title is extracted from the top-level heading, if exists.

### Create a page

Documents placed in `pages_dir` will appear in the site's navigation bar. The timestamp part is only used for sorting purposes here, and can be set to arbitrary values, e.g. `projects.1.md`, `contact.2.md`, etc.
